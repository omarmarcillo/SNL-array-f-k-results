# SNL-array-f-k-results
Results of the f-k analysis and PSDs for the SNL array. 

This data repository covers the results of the f-k analysis of the SNL array described in the paper:
"On infrasound generated by wind farms and its propagation in low-altitude tropospheric waveguides" by Marcillo et al.. 2015. 

The files uploaded here (in the zip file fk_data.zip) correspond to f-k analysis and PSD calculations of the best-beam following the parameters described in the Methods section of the paper. The name of the files have the following format:  
for the file PSDNFK_2014-02-13T20/21/00.000000Z_480_0.7_2_0.19_75.5_3.202_.pd

PSDNFK_YYYY-MM-DDTHH/mm/SS.ffffffZ_WWW_F1_F2_CC_BB_SL_.pd

YYYY: year
MM: month
DD: day

HH: hour
mm: minute
SS.ffffff: second with fraction

WWW: length of the analyzed window in seconds
F1 lower frequency (Hz)
F2 higher frequency (Hz)
CC relative power
BB backazimuth (North 0, degrees)
SL slowness in (s/Km)

Each file has two columns separated by a coma. The first row is the header, the first column is frequency in Hz and the corresponding value of the PSD  (dB/Hz relative to 20 uPa) in the second column.
